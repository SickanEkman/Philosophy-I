# Part 1, chapter 3, what is knowledge? - defining knowledge

## The problem of the criterion

:bulb: :brain: **the problem of the criterion**  
To define *what knowledge is*, I could look at different cases/kinds of knowledge, analyse them and find out what is common among them. This is a problem due to the problem of the criterion:

1. I can only identify instances of knowledge provided I already know what the criteria for knowledge are.
2. I can only know what the criteria for knowledge are provided I am already able to identify instances of knowledge.

> Roderick Chrisholm, 1916-1999. Modern philosopher, really big epistemologist

## methodism and particularism

:bulb: :brain: **Methodism**  
:bulb: :brain: **Particularism**  

A **Methodist** is someone who assumes she already knows - or is able to understand by thinking really hard - what the criteria for knowledge are. Knowing this she can then identify knowledge and tell if it really is knowledge or not.

- Pro: We don't have to worry about scepticism.
- Con: It's quite bold to claim to know the critera for knowledge without analyzing instances of it.

A **Particuliarist** is someone who assumes she can identify particular instances of knowledge whithout knowing the criteria, and then based on this determine what the criteria for knowledge are.

- Pro: It's easier to accept the ability to identify knowledge without criteria than the other way around.
- Con: We have to worry about scepticists, defending how we are able to know something without showing how.

:bulb: :brain: **Scepticism**  
The **sceptist** is somoeone who believes we don't actually know anything much at all.  

## Knowledge as justified true belief

:bulb: :brain: **Tripartite**  
Classical thoughts about knowledge involves adding the criteria of *justification*. That would separate the cases of actual knowledge from cases of luck, or trickery for instance. Then knowledge would be defined as:

1. You believe something
2. What you believ is true
3. You are justified in believing this

## Gettier cases

:bulb: :brain: **Gettier cases**  
The **Gettier cases** is a set of cases brought forward by Gettier (no shit) that shows that the classical account (tripartite) isn't the answer. The article with the cases proves that you might have a justified true belief and *still* lack knowledge, if your true belief is based on luck.

An example (not an original Gettier example though), is of Joanna, who looks at the clock and sees that it is 8.20. Joanna believes that the time is 8.20, this is actually the exact time (ie true), and the belief is justified since it is a reliable clock and the time makes sense. But, Joanna doesn't know the clock has stopped (exactly 24 hours earlier), and therefor *she doesn't have knowledge*! \*Gasp!\*
