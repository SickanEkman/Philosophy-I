# Chapter 3 - defining knowledge

## The problem of the criterion

:bulb: :brain: **the problem of the criterion**  
To define *what knowledge is*, I could look at different cases/kinds of knowledge, analyze them and find out what is common among them. This is a problem due to the problem of the criterion:

1. I can only identify instances of knowledge provided I already know what the criteria for knowledge are.
2. I can only know what the criteria for knowledge are provided I am already able to identify instances of knowledge.

> Roderick Chrisholm, 1916-1999. Modern philosopher, really big epistemologist

## methodism and particularism

:bulb: :brain: **Methodism**  
:bulb: :brain: **Particularism**  

A **Methodist** is someone who assumes she already knows - or is able to understand by thinking really hard - what the criteria for knowledge are. Knowing this she can then identify knowledge and tell if it really is knowledge or not.

- Pro: We don't have to worry about sceptics.
- Con: It's quite bold to claim to know the criteria for knowledge without analyzing instances of it.

A **Particuliarist** is someone who assumes she can identify particular instances of knowledge without knowing the criteria, and then based on this determine what the criteria for knowledge are.

- Pro: It's easier to accept the ability to identify knowledge without criteria than the other way around.
- Con: We have to worry about sceptics, defending how we are able to know something without showing how.

:bulb: :brain: **Skepticism**  
The **sceptic** is someone who believes we don't actually know anything much at all.  

## Knowledge as justified true belief

:bulb: :brain: **Tripartite**  
Classical thoughts about knowledge involves adding the criteria of *justification*. That would separate the cases of actual knowledge from cases of luck, or trickery for instance. Then knowledge would be defined as:

1. You believe something
2. What you believe is true
3. You are justified in believing this

## Gettier cases

:bulb: :brain: **Gettier cases**  
The **Gettier cases** is a set of cases brought forward by Gettier (no shit) that shows that the classical account (tripartite) isn't the answer. The article with the cases proves that you might have a justified true belief and *still* lack knowledge, if your true belief is based on luck.

An example (not an original Gettier example though), is of Joanna, who looks at the clock and sees that it is 8.20. Joanna believes that the time is 8.20, this is actually the exact time (ie true), and the belief is justified since it is a reliable clock and the time makes sense. But, Joanna doesn't know the clock has stopped (exactly 24 hours earlier), and therefor *she doesn't have knowledge*! \*Gasp!\*

To create Gettier cases you need to follow three steps:

1. Create a scenario in where a person would normally have a false belief. Lets say I think the bus is leaving in 2 minutes, not knowing they changed the schedule so that there is a 20 minute wait.
2. Add details that make the belief justified. Lets say I always take this bus at this time, and the old time schedule is still up at the bus stop.
3. Change the reality so that the belief becomes true. In our case, a bus actually arrives in 2 minutes (but it is the previous one, because it got hold up).

## Responding to the Gettier cases

People tried to handle the Gettier cases in different ways. One is to add another criterion to knowledge: the belief can not in any way be based on false presuppositions.

But what counts as a presupposition? If we take this literally, "any false presuppositions" means every associated detail to my belief must also be true. Think about Joanne again: with this new criteria she would not "know" what time it was. But lets say the clock still worked so that she does not hold a false presupposition about the working of the clock, but she also happened to think she got the clock on her birthday, but in fact she received it as a Christmas gift two months earlier. She overestimates the age of the device. She holds one false presupposition, ie she can not be said to have knowledge of the time.

If no false presuppositions can be held it'll be almost impossible to know anything at all.

Another objection to the criteria of false presuppositions is that you might have no presuppositions at all. Joanne - looking at the broken clock - might not know anything about the clock and justify her beliefs by checking 100 other clocks that also happens to be broken and have stopped exactly 24 hours earlier. Then she will hold no false presuppositions, but we do not view her justified true belief with no presuppositions as knowledge.

"The dilemma for proponents of this sort of response to the Gettier cases is thus to
explain how we should understand the notion of a presupposition broadly enough
so that it applies to the Gettier cases while at the same time understanding it narrowly enough so that it doesn’t apply to other non-Gettier cases in which, intuitively, we would regard the agent concerned as having knowledge."

## CHAPTER SUMMARY

- One of the central tasks in epistemology is to offer a definition of knowledge. The problem of the criterion, however, shows us that this task is in fact very difficult, if not impossible.
- Here, in a nutshell, is the problem of the criterion. Suppose we begin the task of defining knowledge by pointing to cases in which we have knowledge and trying to identify what is common to each case. The problem with this suggestion is that it assumes that we can already identify cases of knowledge, and thus that we already know what the marks, or criteria, of knowledge are. Alternatively, we might begin the task of defining knowledge by simply reflecting on the nature of knowledge, and determine its essence that way. That is, through reflection we might determine what the criteria for knowledge are. The problem with this suggestion, however, is that it is difficult to see how we could possibly identify the criteria for knowledge without first being able to identify particular cases of knowledge. It seems, then, that either one must assume that one has (at least some of) the knowledge that one thinks one has, or else one must assume that one knows, independently of considering any particular instance of knowledge, what the criteria for knowledge are. Neither assumption is particularly plausible.
- We next considered a very influential theory of knowledge known as the classical (or tripartite) account of knowledge. According to this proposal, knowledge is to be understood as justified true belief, where a justification for one’s belief consists of good reasons for thinking that the belief in question is true.
- Despite the surface plausibility of the classical account of knowledge, we also saw that it was untenable. This was illustrated by appeal to Gettier cases, which are cases in which one forms a true justified belief and yet lacks knowledge because the truth of one’s belief is largely a matter of luck. (The example we gave of this was that of someone forming a true belief about what the time is by looking at a stopped clock which just so happens to be displaying the right time.)
- There is no easy answer to the Gettier cases; no simple way of supplementing the tripartite account of knowledge so that it can deal with these cases. Instead, a radically new way of understanding knowledge is required, one that demands greater co-operation on the part of the world than simply that the belief in question be true.
