# Chapter 5 - Rationality

## Rationality, justification, and knowledge

Epistemologists tries to answer "what is and isn't rational?"

It is plausible to assume that a justified belief and a rational belief are synonymous.

> :exclamation: ** Note! Although there *is* grounds to view justification and rationality as the same thing, this chapter mostly deals with rationality as something separate from justification because of reasons*

## Epistemic rationality and the goal of truth

:bulb: :brain: **Epistemic rationality**  
**Epistemic rationality** is the form of rationality which aims at the goal of true belief. The difference is this: It was *rational* of me to apply to the first developer job. It would have been *epistemically rational* of me to consider my limitations and not apply yet.

> Blaise Pascal, 1622-1662  
> Religious philosopher shows the distinction between rationality and epistemic rationality when he says *"If god does not exist, one will lose nothing by believing in him, while if he does exist, one will lose everything by not believing"*.  
> Rational to believe in god given this would be true? Yes.  
> Epistemically rational? No.

## The goal(s) of epistemic rationality

:bulb: :brain: **Maximizing truth and minimizing false**  

So how is epistemic rationality even concerned with true belief? One way is looking at epistemic rationality as saying that we want to aim at truth as much as possible. In other words, **maximizing true beliefs**. Ie hold as many truths as possible. To maximize my true beliefs I could just decide to belief anything. But that would give me a lot of false positives. Taking the opposite stance would be **minimizing false beliefs**, which in extreme means not believing anything and that would also be irrational. The key would be to balance the two conceptions of rationality.

## The (un)importance of epistemic rationality

Deciding to seek as much true beliefs as possible without necessarily believing anything could mean learning all numbers in the phone book. This seems irrational. You *could* argue though, that the irrationality of this behavior is not *epistemic*, but irrational in another sense. Which means it is still epistemically rational. This however means that the epistemic rationality is not in fact rationality in a general sense, and this trivialize the importance of epistemology. Which is ... super duper bad, so lets not do that.

A better argument to *not* view seeking as many true beliefs as possible (without necessarily believing anything) as a good way of seeking rationality, is to not accept the behavior itself as epistemically rational after all. Learning phone numbers will not be a way to gain more true beliefs after this. Nothing builds upon those self-standing facts. If I learnt other things instead, like the planets orbits, I will be able to further understand other things related to space. I would in this way maximize my true belief more *not* spending time memorizing phone numbers, but doing other things instead. Ie, memorizing phone numbers is *epistemically irrational*.

"There is thus some room for manoeuver when it comes to this objection to epistemic rationality: one can either accept it while maintaining that its importance can be easily overestimated, or else one can resist it and claim that the cases offered for thinking that being epistemically rational can result in trivial true beliefs are based on a mistake."

## Rationality and responsibility

So far we have assumed that the agents forming and holding beliefs are responsible for the way in which they form their beliefs. This is not always the case though.

Think about perceptual beliefs. They are spontaneous and involuntary, which means I cannot control if I see the cow on the field or not. (Actions however, as the writer explains, are mostly in our control. So Pritchard is a behaviorist!). In this sense I can not really be responsible for forming my belief that there is a cow on the field.

:bulb: :brain: **Epistemic norm**  
A rule which one follows in order to gain true beliefs.

Another example of someone who might not be responsible for forming her believes is someone that might be though the wrong epistemic norms. Lets say she has learnt that you reach the truth by just feeling really strongly about something, and does not know to think logically, or trying to be objective. You could argue that she does acts perfectly epistemically rational, according to her view at least. There is arguably a difference between someone who never learnt something and someone who should know better.

:bulb: :brain: **Deontic epistemic rationality**  
:bulb: :brain: **Epistemic internalism**  
**Deontic epistemic rationality** is the idea that an agent's belief *is* epistemically rational if she forms them without breaking any epistemic norms *that she knows about*. Ie, an agent can be epistemically rational *and* employ the wrong epistemic norms. **Epistemic internalism** makes one’s epistemic standing something that one has control over.

:bulb: :brain: **Non-deontic epistemic rationality**  
:bulb: :brain: **Epistemic externalism**  
**Non-deontic epistemic rationality** is the idea that an agent's beliefs are only epistemically rational if they are formed following the *right* epistemic norms, no matter if she knows about them or not. **Epistemic externalism** allows that one’s epistemic standing can sometimes depend on factors outside one’s control.

## Epistemic internalism/externalism

It thus seems that we are caught between two opposing conceptions of epistemic rationality. The first has the advantage of directly connecting the notion of epistemic rationality with that of responsibility, but has the drawback that the demands it imposes are very weak. The second imposes a stronger constraint on epistemic rationality, but does so at the expense of breaking the link between epistemic rationality and responsibility.

## CHAPTER SUMMARY

- Rationality is important to epistemologists since there seems to be a close connection between having a rational belief and having knowledge (and, conversely, between having an irrational belief and lacking knowledge). Moreover, as we have seen in a previous chapter, knowledge is closely connected with justification, and rationality there seems to be a tight connection between rationally held beliefs and justified beliefs. Understanding rationality could thus cast light on the theory of knowledge, whether indirectly (via the light it casts on justification) or directly.
- The type of rationality that we are interested in as epistemologists is epistemic rationality. Epistemic rationality is specifically aimed at true belief.
- One way of understanding epistemic rationality is that it demands that one should try to maximize one’s true beliefs (i.e. have as many true beliefs as possible).
- We noted two problems with the proposal. The first was that one could achieve this goal by acquiring lots of trivial true beliefs (e.g. by learning all the names in a phone directory). Intuitively, however, this is not a very rational thing to do at all. The second problem that we noted with this proposal was that one could maximize one’s true beliefs by believing as much as possible, but this would also result in lots of false beliefs. Intuitively, however, having truth as a goal means not just having lots of true beliefs, but also avoiding having false beliefs.
- Reflection on the second problem led us to consider a different conception of epistemic rationality, one that demanded not that we maximize true beliefs but that we minimize false ones. The key problem with this proposal, however, is that the best way to go about meeting this requirement is by believing nothing, and this is hardly what we would regard as epistemically rational behavior.
- We thus concluded that what was required of epistemic rationality was to achieve a balance between the two goals of maximizing true beliefs and minimizing false beliefs.
- There still remained the problem of apparently epistemically rational agents who devote themselves to gaining trivial true beliefs (e.g. by learning all the names in a phone book). We saw two ways of responding to this problem. The first response embraced the problem and argued that all that it showed is that there is nothing irrational, from a purely epistemic point of view, with such behavior. The second response argued that the problem was illusory because such cases do not stand up to close scrutiny: the agent in these cases is not, in fact, epistemically rational after all.
- We then distinguished between two conceptions of epistemic rationality: deontic and non-deontic conceptions. According to a deontic epistemic rationality, one is epistemically rational just so long as one forms one’s beliefs responsibly. In this view, one can form one’s beliefs by using the wrong epistemic norms just so long as one does so blamelessly. In contrast, a non-deontic epistemic rationality demands that one employs the right epistemic norms.
- The deontic conception of epistemic rationality is a form of epistemic internalism in that it draws a close connection between epistemic standing and what the agent can be held responsible for. In contrast, the non-deontic conception of epistemic rationality is a form of epistemic externalism in that it allows that one can responsibly form one’s beliefs and yet, because one blamelessly employs the wrong epistemic norms, one’s belief is not epistemically rational. Roughly speaking, epistemic internalism makes one’s epistemic standing something the agent has control over; while epistemic externalism allows that one’s epistemic standing can sometimes depend on factors outside one’s control (e.g. whether one has been taught the right epistemic norms).
- We noted that the deontic conception of epistemic rationality seems closest to our ordinary use of the term ‘rational’ and our ordinary understanding of ‘justification’. Nevertheless, this type of epistemic rationality does not seem to bear such a close relation to knowledge; or at least not as close as a non-deontic conception of epistemic rationality. We thus considered the possibility that there are two distinct epistemological projects: one which examines knowledge, and another which examines justification and deontic epistemic rationality. In this picture, while there may be important connections between the two projects, they are not as closely related as we might at first suppose.
