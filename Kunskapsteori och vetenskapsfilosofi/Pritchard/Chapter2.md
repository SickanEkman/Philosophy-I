# Part 1, chapter 2, what is knowledge? - the value of knowledge

## Why care about knowledge?

A question rarely discussed in epistemology is *"why should we care about whether or not we have knowledge?"*. If we do not care, we do not need to study what knowledge is - which means epistemologists waste their time.

## The instrumental value of true belief

One way of thinking about if knowledge is worth something or not is that *all other things being equal*, knowledge (ie true beliefs) enable us to fulfil our goals. This sort of value that focuses on something being useful for further gain is called **instrumental value**. Knowledge generally has instrumental value. Not always though. Consider these examples:

- If I know what time my meeting starts - I'll be on time for this meeting.
- If I knew about my actual lack of real developer skills when I looked fo my first job - would I have been brave anough to apply?

True belief *generally* has instumental value. Not always.

True beliefs sometimes revolves around something trivial (knowing how many grains of sand there are on this beach, after counting everyone), in which case it is not clear why we should value such true beliefs at all. You could even argue this kind of true believes are worse than they are good, since the process of getting there takes up resources I could use for something more important.

A conclusion of the above is that some true beliefs are instrumentally valuable, but not all. The value of knowledge can, because of this, not solely rely upon the fact that it entails truth and true beliefs have instumental value.

What if we decide that "knowledge == true beleifs that has instrumental value"? Well that's just dumb. The sand counter knows how many grains of sand there is (after counting them), we can't really argue that.

Also, if we use true belief as a way of proving knowledge is valuable, that would be to entail that knowledge is no more valuable than mere true belief. If that were the case, why would we even value knowledge more than mere true belief?

The conclusion is that not all knowledge *is* valuable.

## The value of knowledge

We have concluded that not all knowledge is instrumentally valuable, but also that generally and all other things equal, it is more instumentally valuable to hold knowledge than less. And that there is greater intrumental value to knowledge compared to true belief:

false beliefs < true beliefs < knowledge

Why is knowledge more valuable than true belief? Because true beliefs are unstable. The example from the book is this: I have a (false, which I don't know) map of an area. It just happens to show the correct way to a restaurant I want to go to. I start following the map. I realise along the way the map is false, since all landmarks are wrong. I halt, and do not continue to the restaurant, even though the path happened to be correct. Ie I abandon my true belief. If I *knew* the way to the resturant, I would not abandon my belief so easily.

I think these are better? more clear? examples:

- Remember that true belief can be true by luck. If I correctly guess the lottery numbers the first time and then believe I have the magical ability to do it, I'll (hopefully) abandon this belief when I don't win a second time. If I *know* the correct lottery numbers because I rig the system, I will continue to win and to believe I know how to win.
- If I get my code to compile by guessing the Python syntax and the next time not, I'll probably think I didn't know the syntax. There happened to be an error in the IDE though and that's why it didn't compile. If I *know* the syntax, I'll not waste time debugging the code, but just wait until the IDE feels better.

## The statues of Daedalus

< *Sokrates* taught *Plato*, who taught *Aristoteles*. Plato is considered one of the most influential philosophers. He founded "The Academy" - a kind of early univerity that dealed mainly in philosophy. He also wrote The Theaetetus (amongst other books) which deals with the nature of knowledge.

Plato said something along the lines of "that cool statue made by Deadalus is so well made we must tether it to the ground. Otherwise it'll run away. True belief is easily lost like the statue that runs away, while knowledge is like the tethered statue."

Okay, Plato.

I think an important key to the statement about true belief being unstable compared to knowledge is the fact that knowledge (often/usually) hooks on to other peices of true belief. It fits as part of a system of knowledge I already have. It makes sence. True beliefs the contraty doesn't really exist in a context. It is more isolated and doesn't have solid ground to stand on.

Another point *I think* the writer is trying to make is that knowledge is (or could/should) be based on something. Logical reasoning, experience, something like that. There is "proof" leading up to knowledge. True belief can be based on nothing, or guessing, or weak reasoning. Knowledge is *better*, since it is more reliable, not easily mistaken, trustworthy.

## Is some knowledge non-instrumentally valuable?

Yes. It is a good thing to be wise, for instance, for its own sake, even if you gain nothing from it.

True belief on the other hand, does not have any value except instrumental - and sometimes not even that.

## CHAPTER SUMMARY

- One of the central tasks of epistemology is to explain the value of knowledge. But while it is obvious that we do value knowledge, it is not obvious why this is the case, nor what the nature of this value is.
- One way of accounting for the value of knowledge is to note that if you know a proposition, then you have a true belief in that proposition, and true beliefs are clearly useful, and therefore valuable. In particular, true belief has instrumental value in that it enables you to achieve your goals.
- One problem with this proposal is that it is not obvious that all true beliefs are instrumentally valuable. For one thing, some true beliefs are so trivial that it seems that they have no value at all. For another, sometimes it is more useful to have a false belief than a true belief.
- Moreover, even if one could evade this problem, another difficulty would remain, which is that, intuitively, knowledge is more valuable than mere true belief. If this intuition is right, then we need to say more than simply that knowledge entails true belief and that true belief is instrumentally valuable.
- One option is to say that knowledge is of greater instrumental value than mere true belief, since it is more useful to us (it enables us to achieve more of our goals than mere true belief alone). Part of the explanation one might offer for this could be that there is a ‘stability’ to knowledge which is lacking in mere true belief in that in knowing that something is the case one couldn’t have easily been wrong.
- We also explored another suggestion, which was that some knowledge is of non-instrumental value (i.e. is valuable for its own sake). The example we gave here was that of wisdom. The idea, then, is that while knowledge is generally of greater instrumental value than mere true belief, some knowledge is also, in addition, non-instrumentally valuable (unlike mere true belief, which is never non-instrumentally valuable).
