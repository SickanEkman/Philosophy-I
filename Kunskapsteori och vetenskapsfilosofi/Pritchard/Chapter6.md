# Chapter 6 - Virtues and faculties

## Reliabilism

Knowledge involves a cognitive success which is creditable to the agent. It can not be pure luck. This is something everyone (?) agrees upon.

:bulb: :brain: **Reliabilism**  
A view that knowledge must be true belief that is gained in a reliable way, where ‘reliable’ here means that, at the very least, the method used was more likely to get you to the truth than not. This sort of view is known as reliabilism.

It is possible - as usual - to be tricked into true beliefs even though you use a method that is reliable. Someone might have broken the thermometer but every day adjusts the room temperature to match whatever the broken thermometer is saying. So reliabilism is not the answer to everything either.

## Virtue epistemology

:bulb: :brain: **Epistemic virtue (aka intellectual virtue)**  
**Epistemic virtue** is a character trait that you have acquired which makes you better suited to gaining the truth. It could be conscientiousness for example.

:bulb: :brain: **Cognitive faculty**  
**Cognitive faculty** is also kind of a character trait, but natural and innate, that makes you able to form true beliefs. One example is the perceptual faculty eyesight.
