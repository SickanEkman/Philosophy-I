# Part 1, chapter 1, what is knowledge? - Some preliminaries

The study of epistemology tries to answer questions like "What is knowledge?", among other things.

## Types of knowledge

:bulb: :brain:
**Propositional knowledge**  
**Propositional knowledge** is knowledge about a proposition (I might think of this as a simple statement, saying something about a state). The world is round. Stockholm is the capital of Sweden. Two plus two equals four.

:bulb: :brain: **Ability knowledge**  
**Ability knowledge**, or "know-how", is *one example* of other types of knowledge. Ability knowledge is knowing how to swim. Knowledge about how to make a fire. I might not know the set of propositions involved in swimming, and I might not be able to tell someone how to swim, but I might know how to swim.

I have ability knowledge about programming, but not deep propositional knowledge. I *think* this is correct.

**Note! This book revolves around *propositional* knowledge*

## Two basic requirements of knowledge: truth and belief

All epistemologists agree on these prerequisites for knowing something (or "possessing knowledge"):

1. You *believe* something
2. What you believe is *true*

If I believe the earth is flat but it is not flat, I do not have knowledge about this.
If I do not believe the world is round but it is round, I do not have knowledge about this.

## Knowing vs merely 'getting it right'

Just believing in something that also is true ("true belief") is not *enough* though, since you might believe in something true by accident. Knowing the lottery numbers, as an example.

Epistemologists debate over what must be added to the previous statements about belief and truth for something to be considered knowledge, ie success that is creditable to the agent.

## A brief remark on truth

The word "truth" is of course not as unproblematic as it might seem, when used above. Pritchard uses "true" in the intuitive way - describing somethings actual state no matter our beliefs in them. It is true that the world is round only if the shape of the earth is actually a globe. Propositions are only true if they are actually true, no matter if we believe them or not.

## CHAPTER SUMMARY

- Epistemology is the theory of knowledge. One of the characteristic questions of epistemology concerns what all the myriad kinds of knowledge we ascribe to ourselves have in common: What is knowledge?
- We can distinguish between knowledge of propositions, or propositional knowledge, and know-how, or ability knowledge. Intuitively, the former demands a greater degree of intellectual sophistication on the part of the knower than the latter. Our focus in this book will be on propositional knowledge.
- In order to have knowledge of a proposition, that proposition must be true and one must believe it.
- Mere true belief does not suffice for knowledge, however, since one can gain mere true belief purely by luck, and yet you cannot gain knowledge purely by luck.
- In this book I will be assuming a common-sense objective view of truth which holds that (for the most part at least) merely thinking that something is true does not make it true.
