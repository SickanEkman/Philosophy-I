# Chapter 4 - The structure of knowledge

## Knowledge and justification

We've learnt in previous chapters that justification might not be sufficient for knowledge, but it is necessary. Therefore, we must understand what **justification** is.

## The enigmatic nature of justification

If there is no justification to a belief, there is nothing to distinguish between rational and irrational. Simply making a thing up with no justification does not make it rational no matter if it is true or not. At the same time, being able to justify a belief does not make it true - people back in the day believed the sun orbits the earth. That belief was justified, then.

Anyway, we must be able to justify our beliefs (at least in the majority of cases).

I might justify my belief that the earth travels around the sun because a textbook said so. And I believe the textbook is trustworthy. Ie I justify my belief with another belief. Now how might I justify the belief that the textbook is trustworthy? With another belief. This will just continue in eternity.

:bulb: :brain: **Regress**  
A regress, or more specifically an **infinite regress** is a series of elements that has a starting point but no end. An infinite regress argument is a belief that relies upon a belief that relies upon a belief that relies upon ... Which is pretty much always, the case, right?

At some point we'll also probably arrive at the starting point ("The teacher told me the textbook was trustworthy. I trust my teacher because she knows things. The teacher knows things because she reads a lot of textbooks"). The supporting justification reappears in the chain of justifications, and it becomes a full circle.

## Agrippa's trilemma

> Agrippa, 100 AD  
> An ancient Greek philosopher, more specifically a Pyrrhonian sceptic. These sceptics think you shouldn't assert really anything, and therefore didn't write down much about what they thought. The trilemma is an exception, written down by someone else and attributed to Agrippa.

:bulb: :brain: **Trilemma**  
A problem with three unpalatable options.

There are three obvious answers to "how do you support your beliefs?". None of them are good.

1. My beliefs are unsupported.
2. My beliefs are supported by an infinite chain of justification.
3. My beliefs are supported by a circular chain of justification.

People have come up with ways to avoid all these bad options.

## Infinitism

:bulb: :brain: **Infinitism**  
If you embrace option 2 and concludes that an infinite chain of justifications can actually be viewed as justification for belief, you believe in **infinitism**.

This view has never been very popular. Two goatings.

## Coherentism

:bulb: :brain: **Coherentism**  
Fans of option 2 are believers in **Coherentism**. They say that if the circle of justifications supporting your belief is *big enough*, that is enough justification.

Coherentism is a more popular stance. Five goatings.

> W. V. O. Quine, 1908-2000  
> American philosopher. Important in modern philosophy, especially for his Coheristic work. He viewed *all* claims to be unstable in the sense that they might be proven wrong at some point. And since a circular chain of justification big enough to be valid includes your belief as a whole with no one belief standing apart, a change in one particular justification affects all other believes in your world view.

Coherentism is a somewhat accepted view, partly because it mimics the world. This *is* how we often form our beliefs. My network of beliefs is my worldview, and my worldview is what makes me form new beliefs. 

## Foundationalism

:bulb: :brain: **(Classical) foundationalism**  
Foundationalism is an option that accepts that we can not in fact - at least not all the time - support our beliefs (Agrippas 1:st). And we don't need to since some beliefs are *self-justing*. When I start my chain of justifications I will eventually end up with a special self-justified foundamental belief which stands by itself and does not need any further support.

This view is the most popular one. Seven goatings.

> René Descartes, 1596-1650
> Mathematician and philosopher, and founding father of modern philosophy. He promoted the "method of doubt", which involves trying to disproof every single belief you hold until you can not anymore, in which case you end up with a solid foundation of beliefs that you can then build your knowledge upon. He found that the core belief was the belief that one exist ("I think, therefore I am").
>
> To disproof his beliefs he formulated skeptical ideas about them. Ironically enough, these skeptical ideas turned out to be really good and have influenced philosophy more than his anti-skeptical arguments that he wanted to present.

The biggest problem with foundationalism is that it is so hard to identify these core self-justifying beliefs. Most (all?) agree that we exist, but apart from that, what else?

And if I base my network of beliefs upon this core belief that by definition should not be able to be wrong, what happens when my other beliefs are disproven? Should this not mean that my core belief is wrong too, thus making it actually proven wrong?

And this too - it's kinda hard to see the justification chain from many of by everyday beliefs ("I think the bus arrives in 2 minutes"), all the way down to my core belief. What have they got to do with each other?

## CHAPTER SUMMARY

- We began by noting that, intuitively, if we are to have knowledge then we must be justified in what we believe. We therefore asked the question of what justification is.
- According to Agrippa’s trilemma, there are only three alternatives in this regard, and none of them are particularly appealing on the face of it. The first alternative is to regard one’s belief as being justified by nothing at all; no further grounds. The problem with this option is obvious, since if there is nothing supporting the belief, then in what sense can it be justified? (We used the analogy with a house to illustrate this. A house with no foundations will not stand.) The second alternative is to regard one’s belief as justified by a further ground which, presumably, will be itself another belief. The problem with this suggestion is that this further belief will also need to be justified, since if the original belief is based on an unjustified second belief then it is hard to see how the second belief can offer any support to the first belief. But if the second belief needs to be justified, then that belief will itself need to be supported by a further belief, and so on indefinitely. We thus have an infinite regress looming. (Consider the analogy with the house again. A house with an unending series of foundations will not stand.) Finally, there is the third option of allowing the supporting beliefs, at some point in the chain of justification, to be beliefs that have appeared elsewhere in the chain. This option thus allows circular justifications. This third option is not appealing either, however since a circular chain of justification seems little better than no justification at all. (To return to the analogy, a house with a circular set of foundations, with no foundations holding all the other foundations up, will not stand.) It thus seems hard to fathom how any belief could be justified.
- We considered three responses to Agrippa’s trilemma, where each of them took one of the unpalatable options just mentioned. The first option was infinitism, which holds that an infinite chain of grounds can justify a belief.
- The second response was coherentism, as defended by Quine, which holds that a circular chain of grounds, so long as it has the right sort of properties at any rate (e.g. being large enough), can justify a belief.
- Finally, we looked at foundationalism, and classical foundationalism in particular – as defended by Descartes – which holds that there are some grounds which do not require any further support, and which can thus act as foundations for the beliefs that rest upon them. We noted that what is specific to classical foundationalism is that it regards these ‘foundational’ beliefs as having properties which ensure that they are self-justifying – such as the property of being indubitable or infallibly held. The problem facing this view, however, is that it is difficult to find an account of these foundational beliefs that is plausible while at the same time counting a sufficient number of our beliefs as foundational so that they can support the other beliefs we hold.
