# Part 1, chapter 1, what is knowledge? - The structure of knowledge

## Knowledge and justification

We've learnt in previous chapters that justification might not be sufficient for knowledge, but it is necessary. Therefore, we must understand what **justification** is.

## The enigmatic nature of justification

If there is no justification to a belief, there is nothing to distinguish between rational and irrational. Simply making a thing up with no justification does not make it rational no matter if it is true or not. At the same time, being able to justify a belief does not make it true - people back in the day believed the sun orbits the earth. That belief was justified, then.

Anyway, we must be able to justify our beliefs (at least in the majority of cases).

I might justify my belief that the earth travels around the sun because a textbook said so. And I believe the textbook is trustworthy. Ie I justify my belief with another belief. Now how might I justify the belief that the textbook is trustworthy? With another belief. This will just continue in eternity.

:bulb: :brain: **Regress**  
A regress, or more specifically an **infinite regress** is a series of elements that has a starting point but no end. An infinite regress argument is a belief that relies upon a belief that relies upon a belief that relies upon ... Which is pretty much always, the case, right?

At some point we'll also probably arrive at the starting point ("The teacher told me the textbook was trustworthy. I trust my teacher because she knows things. The teacher knows things because she reads a lot of textbooks"). The supporting justification reappears in the chain of justifications, and it becomes a full circle.

## Agrippa's trilemma

> Agrippa was an ancient Greek philosopher

:bulb: :brain: **Trilemma**  
A problem with three unpalatable options.

There are three obvious answers to "how do you support your beliefs?". None of them are good.

1. My beliefs are unsupported.
2. My beliefs are supported by an infinite chain of justification.
3. My beliefs are supported by a circular chain of justification.

People have come up with ways to avoid all these bad options.
